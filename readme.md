Titanic Survival Prediction Project
This works is a machine learning classification task that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic. It utilizes a Random Forest Classifier model to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the ship's sinking. The dataset used for this project contains various features such as age, sex, class, and more.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering for model suitability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into data, understand feature distribution.

Model Training: Train a Random Forest Classifier for survival predictions.

Feature Importance: Analyze and identify influential features on survival predictions.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using cross-validation with various metrics.

Conclusion: Summarize findings, noting age, sex, and Pclass as significant factors for survival.
